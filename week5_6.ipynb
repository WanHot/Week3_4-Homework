    "##Theory Question\n",
    "Question1\n",
    "a is true. Because the second player will play optimally, and so is perfectly predictable up to ties. When someone knows the first player to move, it is not useful for the second player. \n",
    "b is false.In this game, once the person knows the second player how to move, that means the person gets more information about the game, it is unfair for two players.\n",
    "c is false. Backgammon game is about chance. It will much better for dice to roll consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question2\n",
    "（1）Constraint: a constraint is a variable that restricts two or more possible values.\n",
    "（2）backtracking: backtracking is a deep first search (DFS).For specific search trees (search trees are roles that record paths and state judgments), backtracking and DFS.The main difference is that backtracking is not part of the solution.Complete tree structures are preserved.The depth-first search records complete search trees.\n",
    "（3） consistency: A directional arc in CSP from variable A to variable B is consistent for each value in the current A field.\n",
    "Backjumping: backjumping is a way to make backtracking search more efficient, and when a dead end is encountered, there is more than one level back.\n",
    "（4）minimum conflict: minimum conflict is a heuristic used to search for CSP problems locally.The heuristic method is to select values that conflict least with other variables when given a variable to modify.\n",
    "（5）cycle cutset: cycle cutset is a set of variables that are made non-cyclic (i.e., a tree) when removed from the constraint graph.When the variables of the circular cut set are instantiated, the rest of the CSP can be solved in linear time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ouestion3\n",
    "The most constrained variable makes sense because it chooses a variable that is (all other things being equal) likely to cause a failure, and it is more efficient to rail as early as possible (thereby pruning large parts of the search space). The least constraining value heuristic makes sense because it allows the most chances for future assignments to avoid conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 4\n",
    "This program will give you the wrong result.Mathematically, this process amounts to assuming an average tolerance of mm and Max, which is not the case.Intuitively, in the deterministic tree, each player's choice is based on a full understanding of the future dice roll, and there is no necessary relationship to the action made without that knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question5\n",
    "The algorithm USES Depth First Search to traverse the decision tree to fill the value of interest of the middle node of the tree.Generally, the branches of the decision tree grow exponentially, so it is impossible to traverse the entire decision tree. Therefore, in practical applications, the depth of the decision tree is usually controlled to reduce the calculation.Because the complete decision tree cannot be traversed, the algorithm may be misleading, that is, the selected scheme may be locally optimal rather than globally optimal.Sometimes you have to increase the depth of the search tree to get better results, which adds a lot of computation.To speed up the computation and reduce the amount of computation, we can use the Alpha Beta Pruning algorithm to prune the search tree.Because there are many branches in the search tree that do not need to be traversed."
